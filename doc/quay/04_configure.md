# NOTE: This step is not needed for internal OCS/ODF, only for external RGW/Ceph

## Get the Quay config editor URL
```bash
oc get route -n openshift-operators | egrep quay-config-editor | awk '{print $2}'
```

## Get the Quay config editor password
The user ID is "quayconfig"

Unfortunately, depending on which of the 3 editor pods you hit, you will have a different password so you will need all password handy. :(

The following will extract the 3 passwords:
```bash
for i in $(oc get secret -n openshift-operators | egrep quay-config-editor | awk '{print $1}'); do \
  oc get secret -n openshift-operators $i -o json | egrep password | awk -F '"' '{print $4}' | base64 -d
  echo
done
```
